<ul>
	<li>Sigh No More- I enjoyed this album the best. It included all of the banjo and folkiness that I love about them.</li>
	<li>Babel- I enjoyed this one slightly less but still liked it. It became slightly more soft rock but still included elements of folk.</li>
	<li>Wilder Mind- This album was a piece of trash and Mumford and Sons completely lost their sense of identity. I did not enjoy.</li>
